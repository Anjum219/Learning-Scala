# Learning-Scala
In this repository, I will be adding the basics I learned from Scala and
how we can replace basic code blocks by using Scala's own methods!

Let's begin with a [simple problem solving](https://github.com/Anjum219/Learning-Scala/blob/main/learn-from-naive.scala)!

Later we are gonna be familiar with Scala's most useful purposes like
writing, iterating collection stored in multiple nodes of a server!
